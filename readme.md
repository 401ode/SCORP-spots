# Hi!

This is the code for a website that shows the spots myself, my friends (or Twitter friends) have found to be excelent hacking spots around the whole wide world.

## But How?

A Google Spreadsheet holds all the data and it is connected to this website using the goodies in [sheetsee.js](http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js). Everytime you visit the website, you'll have the most up to date data that has been entered into the spreadsheet.
